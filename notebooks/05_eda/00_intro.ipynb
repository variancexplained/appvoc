                "As of May 2023, Apple's App Store offered over 1.76 million apps across 70 categories, accounting for over 62% of the global revenue share in 2022. \n",

                "This iterative, yet lean, exploratory data analysis (EDA) of over 300,000 apps across 26 categories aims to discover patterns, trends and clusters of opinion, and to generate actionable, high-impact insights for opportunity discover and analysis.\n",

[Stage one](notebooks/02_eda/01_app.ipynb) is a high-level examination of the basic product descriptive information, as well as price, average rating, rating count and developer data. During [stage two](notebooks/02_eda/02_rating.ipynb), a subset of the data will provide review count and rating histograms of the distribution of ratings and counts, evincing the range and intensity of customer opinion. Lastly, our [stage three](notebooks/02_eda/03_review.ipynb) analysis turns qualitative as we analyze customer sentiment from reviews, vis-a-vis ratings. \n"
